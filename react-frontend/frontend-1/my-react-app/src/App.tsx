//   return (
//     <div>
//       <h1 className="text-3xl font-bold">

// Okay, so, we'll use this page for the landing page.
// In the src folder, you'll find the pages folder, and in the pages folder, you find the different pages files, like BookingPage.tsx, HomePage.tsx, LoginPage.tsx, SignupPage.tsx, etc.
// You'll also find a components folder, where you can create reusable components like headers, footers, navbars, etc.
// For now, just focus on getting the landing page set up here in App.tsx.
// We'll be using React Router for navigation, so make sure to import Routes and Route from "react-router-dom" then set up routes for different pages as needed.
// Let's all try to do our parts and then we can integrate them later.
// So, about creating branches, yes, each of us should create our own branch from the main branch for the features we're working on.
// For example, if you're working on the login page, create a branch named "login-page" from the main branch. This way, we can work independently without conflicts.
// When you want to push your changes, make sure you're on your feature branch and then push to that branch.
// Once your feature is complete and tested, you can create a pull request to merge your branch back into main.
// This approach helps keep our work organized and makes collaboration easier.
// As for the fonts, we'll be making use of Quicksand. It's a clean font. I've imported it in the index.html file using Google Fonts. You can apply it to your components using Tailwind CSS classes or custom CSS as needed.
// Let's try to build the UI components first, and then we can integrate the authentication logic later.
